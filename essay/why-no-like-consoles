# Why no like consoles?

No one is against the consoles. We've all used them for decades and we have fond memories playing their games. But in this day an age their business model is antiquated, their hype is seethrough and fundamental gears of their "generation cycle" like explisives are intolerable.  

This has to stop. And it will stop. No doubt about it. 

Why mourn the death of consoles anyway? I liked arcades when I was young. It's like saying that the console market should never have existed because I like arcades. The consoles killed the arcades and the browser will kill the consoles. It's inevitable. How can you beat open source, no licensing and destributed development and universal access? 

No need for dispair. There's still a market for settop boxes that use the browser as their main viewport. Maybe the next PlayStation of Xbox should be akin to a [Chromebox](https://www.google.com/work/chrome/devices/asus-chromebox/index.html). 

Either way, the big players have hav already made enough billions - no need to worry about Sony or Microsoft. They'd probably be happy moving their focus away from a 30 year old industry anyway...
